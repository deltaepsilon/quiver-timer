Quick Intro:

I'm a solo web developer/entrepreneur working on an interval timer app for web, iOS and Android. You can find it at hiitclock.com.


HiiTClock.com

HiiT Clock is built so that users can create their own interval timers with named periods and descriptions and play them on their phones, tablets, smart TVs or Chromecast devices. It has visual and sound queues to tell you where you are in your workout, so it works great with a screen or even with just headphones. 

Potential Collaboration

Creating timers can be a pain. I've done everything I can to make the process simple, but it's still nicer to use someone else's timers.

I'm working on a search feature so that users can search for existing timers and import them to their own timer "playlists".  I'm currently seeding this feature with a ton of publicly available workouts, such as Stronglifts.com programs and the CrossFit benchmark workouts.

I suspect that your users would benefit from HiiT Clock and it could help make your system even more powerful if I were to create timers for your public videos. People could access your workouts without needing YouTube. HiiT Clock users would also see Fitness Blender workouts front and center in the app.

You guys have a ton of workouts. Creating timers for all of them is a huge task... so I figured I'd reach out to you before setting off down that path. I'd also like to make sure that you're cool with me using your workouts. I run a web business myself, and I wouldn't want to be accused of knocking off your content.

Let me know if you're open so some sort of collaboration.

People could save your workouts on the HiiT Clock app for use when they don't have internet access or would rather use headphones. HiiT Clock users would also see Fitness Blender workouts front and center in the app, and I could build in links to your videos or other content.

I want to be sure that you're cool with me using your workouts. I run a web business myself, and I wouldn't want to be accused of knocking off your content. And there are other ways I could integrate into your system if you're interested :)

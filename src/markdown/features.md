### Logged-in Mode
Log in with Google or Facebook to save your timer library across multiple devices and app reloads.

### Guest Mode
Stuck on a public computer? Not down with Google or Facebook? Guest Mode is your friend.

Your timers will save locally, but they won't sync across devices, and they'll be blown away when you log out of the app.

### Native app
HiiTClock.com is a hybrid web/Android app. Save it to your homescreen for a native-app experience.

### Chromecast
Chrome browsers on both Android and desktop computers can use the Chromecast button to send timers to a television. This is not supported on iOS 😡

### Apple AirPlay
Use [Apple AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289) to mirror your iOS Screen to an Apple TV. 

Of course, this doesn't work on Android devices, so you're out of luck if you have an Android and an Apple TV. If you're on Android, you need to [buy a Chromecast](https://store.google.com/category/streaming_devices?hl=en). The 2015 Chromecast costs $35 and it's fantastic. Buy one for your gym's TV. Everyone will thank you.

### Share active timers
On any timer page, notice the share icon in the top nav. Click it to open the share dialog. Enable sharing to send your timer to a publicly available page. Anyone can access this page, and it's particularly useful for putting up on a television.

### Background sound alerts
Android and the desktop Chrome will play your selected alert chimes in the background. iOS does not support background sound, so you're out of luck. There's nothing I can do to fix this.

### Foreground sound alerts
All browsers support foreground sound. Click the Settings gears to configure your alerts.

### Screen flash alerts
Click the settings gears to toggle background flash alerts. These alerts are super useful on a television or if you just have your phone sitting next to you while you work out and don't want a chime.

### Shareable timers
Timers that you create will be shared by default. You can, of course, make them private if necessary but sharing makes the world a better place :)

The timer search bar will filter your timer library and search for public timers that you haven't added to your library yet. As the HiiT Clock timer library grows, you'll spend less time configuring your timers and more time getting work done.

## Tips

### Configure your timers like a pro
When cofiguring a timer, check and un-check periods to activate the delete/copy buttons across the bottom of the screen. Use these buttons to quickly duplicate or delete groups of periods.

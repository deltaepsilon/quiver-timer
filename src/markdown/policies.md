### Privacy
We collect only basic profile information from Google and/or Facebook. That's usually just your email, a name and a profile image if you have it configured with your authentication provider. Use Guest Mode if you'd rather not share even an email address.

Upon logging in, you'll receive an email invitation to join our mailing list. That list is managed by MailChimp, and you're welcome to reject the invitation if you're not interested in the goodies that we send out.

That's it. If you opt in to our email list, we'll send you email. Of course you can cancel at any time.

We don't share your information with anyone beyond that initial email invite.

### Security
Our security strategy is that if we don't store it, we can't lose it. All authentication is handled through your third-party authentication provider, either Google or Facebook... so we don't see your login details at any time, and there's nothing to leak.

Even if our systems were entirely compromised (which is unlikely... it's not like HiiT Clock is a bank), the most that anyone is going to get is your email address, name, profile image and a list of your workouts.

### Marketing
We're not sure how we'll earn enough revenue to pay for HiiTClock.com. 

The ideas currently revolve around basic affiliate marketing, where we negotiate deals for you with third-party sellers and then invite you to take advantage of those deals. Think of the SquareSpace advertisements on podcasts and YouTube, where you get an offer code that you can use with SquareSpace, or some other service.

We might have to get more creative about how we market at some point, but we promise to keep it unobtrusive and respectful. You don't owe us anything. We thank ***you*** for spending time on our app, and hope that we can provide such a great service that you'll consider spending money with our partners.

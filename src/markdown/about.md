# About

## Greetings!

My name is Chris, and I got started building HiiT Clock after switching to an Android phone and getting frustrated with the generally horrible quality of Android timer apps.

I'm a freelance web developer, so I wanted something that worked across all devices like a good web app should. I also wanted something that would support my CrossFit and powerlifting habits. I've been lifting for years, and I'm a busy guy, so maximizing my time at the gym is critical. I like to keep tight work/rest periods, and very few timers are built for that sort of workflow.

My favorite timer was [Interval Timer](http://www.intervaltimer.com/), also known as ***Seconds Pro*** on iOS and Android. The [developer is great](https://twitter.com/loadedwino), and the app is soooo close to what I wanted... but I need a few advanced features—especially for Android—that Seconds Pro doesn't support, and if I need them, there's got to be someone else out there looking for them as well.

My stated goal with HiiT Clock is to build the best timer app available for my CrossFit/powerlifting use case. I've been using it for months, and I'm confident that I've crushed that goal.

## Feature requests

I have a list of crazy features that I'd like to build. If HiiT Clock builds a strong enough user base that I can justify spending more time on it, I'll start chipping away at my "advanced features" list. Most of these advanced features will take between one and six weeks to complete. For perspective, the core app took ~3 months to write.

### Please send me feature request and bug reports!

Use the in-app feedback button to send me messages, or tweet at me [@ChrisEsplin](https://twitter.com/ChrisEsplin). I try to be as responsive as possible. I can't guarantee that I won't be on some sort of trip, but if I've got internet and some downtime, I try to clear my inbox every morning.

Happy suffering!

Chris Esplin

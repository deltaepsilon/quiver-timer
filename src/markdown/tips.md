# Tips & Tricks

### Use Guest Mode
Logging in lets you save timers, but sometimes you're on a public computer and don't want to log into your Google account... Guest Mode is your friend.

### Search all of the timers
Use the search bar to find shared timers and to filter your own library.

### Configure your timers like a pro
When cofiguring a timer, check and un-check periods to activate the delete/copy buttons across the bottom of the screen. Use these buttons to quickly duplicate or delete groups of periods.

### Share your timers publicly
On any timer page, notice the share icon in the top nav. Click it to open the share dialog. Enable sharing to send your timer to a publicly available page. Anyone can access this page, and it's particularly useful for putting up on a television.

### Chromecast to your TV
Use any Chrome browser, either on the desktop or Android, to send your screen to Chromecast.

### iOS ❤️ AppleTV
Use [Apple AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289) to mirror your iOS Screen to an Apple TV.
